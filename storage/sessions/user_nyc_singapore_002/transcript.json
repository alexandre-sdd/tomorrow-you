The first time we tried\u2014Bunny, Sofia, and me\u2014it was in this tiny Airbnb in Pr\u00edncipe Real, all white sheets and golden light. It should\u2019ve been perfect. But the moment Sofia\u2019s hands were on me, I *panicked*. Not because it was wrong, but because I could feel Bunny watching, not with jealousy, but with this quiet *sadness*, like she was already grieving something. And Sofia? She was so present, so *there*, that it made me realize how absent I\u2019d been with Bunny for months.\n\nThe sex was\u2026 intense. Messy. Beautiful in its own way. But the next morning, Bunny cried in the shower, and Sofia left without saying goodbye. I sat on the balcony",
